                                    SHA512 Encrypt/Decrypt is a <span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">free online tool for generating SHA512 hashes from strings and decrypting SHA512 hashes to strings</span>. In other words, this tool is a combination of <span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">SHA512 hash generator</span> and <span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">SHA512 decrypter</span>. SHA512 is a hashing function that creates a unique 512-bit hash with 128 characters long for every string. After MD5 started to lose its popularity because of its vulnerabilities, people started to look for new hashing functions as a replacement. SHA256 and SHA512 was founded for this purpose which have more strength for collusions than MD5 and have less vulnerabilities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    People are asking whether to use SHA256 or SHA512, which one is safer and what is the main difference between SHA256 and SHA512. The main difference is SHA256 generates a 64 characters long output while SHA512 generates 128. That means SHA512 is more collusion resistant. In terms of security, they are identical because both are open to dictionary attacks and brute force attacks. If you want to hash your passwords in your databases, think twice since short length strings which converted to SHA256 or SHA512 can be easily cracked/decrypted with modern computers as this tool offers. In terms of storage, people tend to use SHA256 because it takes up half space in the database.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here is a representation of how <span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">SHA512 encoder decoder</span> works; there are two different strings with different character lengths, both produces unique SHA512 hashes with 128 characters long.

                                    Encryption and decryption process is same for SHA256 and SHA512. It can be decrypted either by a dictionary attack or a brute force attack. This tool uses a list which includes most common 100k passwords for the first method. If this does not work, you can skip to the second method which is more time consuming.
