                                    Slugs are not only important for addressing web pages, but they are also used in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to improve the search engine ranking. It is important to have a SEO-friendly slug for every page on your website. Before then, people are not aware of having a SEO-friendly slug, so they may use unique identifiers, dates or random numbers to address the page. New trend is to slugify the pages by using a title of the page. It also gives information about the page if the URL is used as a link.

                                <p>
                                    For achieving SEO-friendly URL slugs, the advised way is to use a combination of the following components:
                                </p>
                                <ol className="space-y-4 text-md font-semibold md:text-base text-gray-700 list-decimal list-inside mb-5">
                                    <li className="pl-2 marker:text-gray-800">Use lower case letters and numbers only.</li>
                                    <li className="pl-2 marker:text-gray-800">Use dash as a separator</li>
                                    <li className='pl-2 marker:text-gray-800'>Remove special characters</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    There is also a concept called "<span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">stop words</span>". Stop words are the most common words in English or any other language which are not the main words but the ones that used like a connector between words. For example, the word "the" is a stop word in English. Some examples for stop words are: "a", "about", "above", "after", "again", "against", "all", "am", "an", "and", "any", "are", "as", "at" ... and so on. Some people prefer the remove stop words in slugs since they are not the key elements of the slug and shorter slugs are better in terms of usage. But some are preferred to keep them in slugs. You can set it according to your preference.
