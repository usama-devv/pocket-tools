                                    There are 4 different clip-path types, polygon, circle, ellipse and inset. Most widely used CSS clip-path type is polygon. You can put as much dots as you want to obtain a polygon and this shape will be used as a reference to you image mask. There are many geometric polygon shapes are available in the tool to use as a template to obtain the desired clip-path. They are varying from simple geometric shapes to more complex structures.
