                                    A <span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">tweet screenshot (tweet snapshot or tweet picture)</span>, can be shared through Twitter internally, but there are some drawbacks to share them directly within Twitter. First, if someone delete his/her tweet or make it protected, it will not be shown where you share it. Converting them into images is a good idea to make them permanent. Also, you can share these tweet images in other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. easily. If you are looking for a solution for the question "<span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">How to post tweets on Instagram?</span>" or "<span className="font-bold text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-[#b9b8ff]">How to post tweets on Pinterest?</span>", this tool is what you need. There are image orientation options you can set just below the image. You can set it to "Square" if you want to share it on Instagram or Pinterest as their native image orientation is square. It will perfectly fit by this way. In addition to protect the tweet from being deleted, you can add customized background images to make them more attractive. By this way, you can increase the interaction of your followers. If you are a social media phenomenon, celebrity or a business who manage many social media platforms at once and want to share your tweets on other platforms, you can share your tweets on Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, etc. easily by converting them into nice looking images.
