                                    A thumbnail is an image that represents a video. It gives a first impression about the video to the user, so it is very important as users mostly decided to click the content or not by looking these pictures. Attractive and intriguing images are preferred to increase click rate. It is usually displayed in a player, and it is also used in search results. The thumbnail is usually displayed in a small size, but there are many different sizes for the thumbnails according to usage areas. If it is used in a result list, then there will be more than one on the screen at the same time and small one will be used. If there is only one embedded player on the page with full size, then a bigger one will be preferred as a cover.

                                    For different reasons like using it in your designs or using it as a cover or poster, you may need them. Since the ID of video and thumbnail is not equal to each other in contrary to YouTube, it is not possible to extract it directly even if you know the URL structure. Therefore, you need to use API endpoint and fetch the meta data from there to obtain results.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When you are on Vimeo for uploading a new video, Vimeo uses same image as a thumbnail for different solutions and the size of the image is set with a URL parameter. If you use API of Vimeo to get info about the video, if offers a set of thumbnails, but maximum width is 640px, so it is not sufficient for most of the cases. People may need HD thumbnails of Vimeo videos. In contrary to API result, 10015 Vimeo thumbnail downloader offers HD thumbnails of Vimeo videos. Here are the available resolutions. By that way, you can grab HD images of the same media directly.
